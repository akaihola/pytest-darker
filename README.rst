Requirements
============

* Pytest_
* Darker_

There is a minimum requirement of Darker_ 1.1.0 later.


Installation
============

::

    $ pip install pytest-darker


Usage
=====

To run pytest with checks provided by Darker_::

    $ pytest --darker

The plugin will output a diff of suggested formatting changes from Black_ (if any exist).
Changes will _not_ be applied automatically.


Customizing Black and isort behavior
====================================

Project-specific default options for Black_ and isort_
are read from the project's ``pyproject.toml`` file in the repository root.
isort_ also looks for a few other places for configuration.

For more details, see:

- `Black documentation about pyproject.toml`_
- `Black example configuration`_
- `isort documentation about config files`_



Testing
=======

To run the tests against a selection of Python interpreters::

    $ tox

To run against a specific interpreter (e.g. Python 3.6)::

    $ tox -e py36

The ``tox.ini`` file in the root of this repository
is used to configure the test environment.
